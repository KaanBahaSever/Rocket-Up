Hello!
# Rocket Simulation Library

Welcome to the **Rocket-Up** simulation library! This project aims to model various aspects of rocket flight, from engine thrust to atmospheric conditions.

## Features
- Modular structure for rocket components
- Expandable environment and planet classes
- Configurable flight simulation parameters

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the project (e.g., with CMake or your preferred build system).
3. Run the example `main.cpp` to see basic usage.

## Roadmap
- Add more rocket components (fins, body tubes, nose cones).
- Integrate physics libraries to refine simulations.
- Expand to multiple planetary environments.
- Improve performance and add GPU acceleration.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
